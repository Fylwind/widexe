Windows Executable Identifier
=============================

Simple tool that identifies the subsystem of a Windows executable, i.e. is it
a console program, a GUI program, or something else?

This is based on the sample code in article
[KB90493](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/90493) (*HOWTO: How To Determine
Whether an Application is Console or GUI*).

To compile, run `nmake` in the Visual Studio Command Prompt.
